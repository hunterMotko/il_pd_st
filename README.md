## Project Overview

The project was commissioned by the Illinois Supreme Court and the
Administrative Office of Illinois Courts, following an evaluation of Illinoisâ€™
public defense system by the Sixth Amendment Center. The evaluation revealed
major structural deficiencies within Illinois' public defense system, including
lack of oversight and independence. This project was motivated by the need to
provide Illinois public defenders with a user-friendly platform to analyze and
visualize statistical data.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Server-side rendering and routing: Next.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- CI/CD: GitHub CI/CD
- Hosting: Digital Ocean

## Key Features

One of the key features of this project is the creation of interactive maps for
data visualization. Users can explore statistical data in a visually appealing
and intuitive manner. The project also focuses on optimizing web performance
metrics, such as First Content Paint, Largest Content Paint, Total Blocking
Time, and layout shift.

## Technical Details

The project involved improving database query times and API response times.
Advanced techniques using PostgreSQL Aggregates, Functions, and Indexes were
implemented to enhance data retrieval efficiency, resulting in a more
streamlined and responsive user experience.

## About the Data
The data presented on this website is the result of a comprehensive research
conducted by a team from Northwestern University. The team collected and
analyzed data on resource distribution across all 102 counties in Illinois,
providing a comprehensive, statewide database on public defense implementation
in Illinois.

## Contributions

The project was a collaborative effort. My personal contribution included
designing and implementing the frontend components, integrating the backend
functionality, optimizing performance, and collaborating with the team to
ensure seamless deployment. I am incredibly proud of this project as it allowed
me to harness my skills in full stack development, data visualization, and
performance optimization. The end result was a polished and efficient
application that met the client's requirements and provided valuable insights
for Illinois public defenders.
